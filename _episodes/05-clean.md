## Cleaning workspace

Remember to delete your workflow again to avoid additional charges:
Run this until you get a message indicating there is no more workflows.

```bash
argo delete -n argo @latest
```

Delete the argo namespace and all yaml files and configurations with:

```bash
kubectl delete ns argo
rm *
rm -r *
```

Delete your disk:
```bash
gcloud compute disks delete DISK_NAME [DISK_NAME …] [--region=REGION     | --zone=ZONE]
```
